# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

## Description

This is my final capstone for Thinkful's Software Engineering program. I was tasked with creating a full-stack reservation system for a mock restaurant, _Periodic Tables_. The goal was to complete 8 user stories within a monorepo and successfully deploy a live website. This applications allows the restaurant employees to book, edit, cancel, and search for reservations in the database using customers' phone numbers.
